The objective of this work is the development of an integrated control system, whose aim is to optimize the energy consumption and the user comfort. The focus of the first part of this work is on the analysis of the different subsystems. The entire control system is described in detail. The cross coupling, which links the thermal system with the lighting system, is specified. This allows a separation of the control algorithms according to the requirements. The core objective of this paper is the design of several intelligent thermal control algorithms. An algorithm using a Fuzzy controller and an adapting power profile, a controller which uses the same algorithm as mentioned before but which optimizes the Fuzzy controller parameters using Genetic Algorithms and a generalized predictive controller (GPC) are presented. Different aspects of the control strategies, the diverse specifications of the algorithms and any restrictions concerning the implementation are listed. Last but not least simulation results of different controllers are presented and discussed.

In this framework, a controller consists of constraint solving components distributed in a network of embedded processors. Constraint solvers are goal oriented deliberative agents that can be used as control regulators or as information retrievers. The framework is built on the Attribute/Service Model (ASM), a middleware for coordinating actuators, sensors and tasks in distributed real-time embedded systems. The communications and coordination among the services are realized via shared attributes. Examples of controlling a modular self-reconfigurable robot are illustrated in the paper.

Part 2: MDOF systems	EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS			English	Article						structural control; semi-active control; seismic response	STIFFNESS	In this paper, the performance of active interaction control (AIC) algorithms is assessed within the context of two realistic building models. The AIC control approach is proposed as a semi-active means of mitigating the structural response during large earthquakes. To implement the AIC control algorithms into MDOF systems, the modal control (MC) approach that directs the control effort to certain dominant response modes is formulated and utilized herein. Two structures, a 3-storey building and a 9-storey steel-framed benchmark building controlled by the AIC algorithms are analysed for two historical earthquake records. The results of numerical simulation verify the efficacy of the AIC control algorithms in controlling vibration of building structures during large earthquakes.

J	Penner, RR; Steinmetz, ES				Penner, RR; Steinmetz, ES			Model-based automation of the design of user interfaces to digital control systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						building management systems; cooperative systems; design automation; user interfaces; user modeling		Digital control systems, like those controlling the functions of buildings or industrial processes, pose a number of special problems for good user interface design. The general problems of providing usability, common to all systems, include difficulty in accessing and applying principles of good design. In addition, digital control systems can have multiple users, with multiple roles, and each installation has different configurations of systems, controls, and user interface devices. Providing interactions for the users of building control systems is often achieved by manually implementing each required display. This is an expensive solution, which often produces less than optimal results. We address these problems through the automation of user interface design. Our solution, called DIGBE (Dynamic Interface Generation for Building Environments), separates domain knowledge, interaction design, and presentation heuristics into multiple collaborating models. Each model contains knowledge about a particular aspect of interface design, and uses this knowledge to dynamically create each user interface that is needed to support the users of a control system. DIGBE demonstrates that it is possible to automatically and dynamically create consistent and individualized user interfaces from model-based design knowledge.

Scenarios in current research do not fit commercial buildings, in which both building operators and occupants can participate in operation decisions. Although personal control systems have been available to commercial buildings, individual differences in comfort requirements have not been fully addressed in control strategies. For most commercial buildings, control decisions are still based on generalized human requirements. This paper presents an agent-based control framework that accounts for individual differences and mitigates potential requirement conflicts.

Re-configurable digital signal processing using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is now preferred over Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for high performance applications. The FPGAs, due to their re-programmable and dynamic nature, are more suitable in developing hardware implementations because several configurations can be tested and experimented easily without any additional hardware cost. Being small, lightweight and power-efficient, FPGAs are one of the best platforms for building controllers for smart structures. Distributed Arithmetic is a widely used technique for hardware efficient implementations of inner product between a fixed and a variable data vectors. The computational requirements of smart structural controller match this type very well. The objective of the research is to design easily configurable stand-alone smart controller, which could be used for real-time control applications. Self-configurable controllers are implemented and tested on a cantilevered beam.

We partnered with an innovative building operator to evaluate a prototype information monitoring and diagnostic system (IMDS). The IMDS consists of a set of high-quality sensors, data acquisition software and hardware, and data visualization software including a web-based remote access system, that can be used to identify control problems and equipment faults. The information system allowed the operators to make more effective use of the building control system and freeing up time to take care of other tenant needs. They report observing significant improvements in building comfort, potentially improving tenant health and productivity. The reduction in the labor costs to operate the building is about US$ 20,000 per year, which alone could pay for the information system in about 5 years. A control system retrofit based on findings from the information system is expected to reduce energy use by 20% over the next year, worth over US$ 30,000 per year in energy cost savings. The operators are recommending that similar technology be adopted in other buildings. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It is usually also the most cost-effective way to improve energy efficiency of air-conditioned buildings. In this article, the comfort enhancement and energy saving potential with new control strategies are determined for the Human Science Building (HSB) at the University of Pretoria. A new software tool, QUICKcontrol, was used to perform the complex and fully integrated building, HVAC and control simulations. Various control strategies were investigated. These included air-bypass, reset control, setback control, improved start-stop times, economiser control and CO, control. The simulation models were firstly verified against measurements to ensure accurate and realistic retrofit simulations. It was then possible to ensure comfort and to predict savings of 60% in HVAC power consumption. This resulted in a simple payback period of 9 months. Preparing input data took about 2 days, while setting up the simulation model took another day. The typical run time for the fully integrated building, HVAC system and control simulation took approximately 90 s per day on an Intel(TM) Pentium 133 MHz personal computer.

J	Kim, T; Kato, S; Murakami, S				Kim, T; Kato, S; Murakami, S			Indoor cooling/heating load analysis based on coupled simulation of convection, radiation and HVAC control	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Air Distribution in Rooms (ROOMVENT 2000)	JUL 09-12, 2000	UNIV READING, READING, ENGLAND		UNIV READING	cooling load; CFD; HVAC control; coupled simulation		A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation for analyzing indoor cooling/heating load is presented in this study. It is coupled with a radiative heat transfer simulation and heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) controlling system in a room. This new method feeds back the outputs of the HVAC system control to the input boundary conditions of the CFD, and this method includes a human model to evaluate the thermal environment. It would be used to analyze the heating/cooling loads of different HVAC systems under the condition of the same human thermal sensation (e.g. PMV, operative temperature, etc.) even though the temperature and air-velocity distribution in the room are different from each other. To examine the performance of the new method, a cooling load and a thermal environment within a semi-enclosed space, which opens into an atrium space, is analyzed under the steady-state conditions during the summer season. This method is able to analyze the indoor cooling load with changes of target thermal environments of a room and/or changing clothing conditions of occupants considering the temperature and air-velocity distribution in the room. In this paper, two types of HVAC system are compared; i.e. radiation-panel system and all-air cooling system. The radiation-panel cooling system is found to be more energy efficient for cooling the semi-enclosed space. Changes of the level of thermal environment reduce cooling load effectively in case of the all-air cooling system while the radiation-panel system does not reduce cooling load even though the targeted thermal condition is relaxed. Energy saving effect is expected by easing the clothing conditions of occupants. In this study, the reducing effect of cooling load is quantitatively evaluated with clothing conditions also.

The new control technique is presented and tested in a numerical study that involves two types of building models. The energy of each building is dissipated through magnetorheological (MR); dampers whose damping properties are continuously updated by a fuzzy controller. This semi-active control scheme relies on the development of a correlation between the accelerations of the building (controller input) and the voltage applied to the MR damper (controller output). This correlation forms the basis for the development of an intelligent neuro-fuzzy control strategy. To establish a context for assessing the effectiveness of the semi-active control scheme, responses to earthquake excitation are compared with passive., to numerical strategies that have similar authority for control. According simulation, MR dampers are less effective control mechanisms than passive dampers with respect to a single degree of freedom (DOF) building model. On the other hand, MR dampers are predicted to be superior when used with multiple DOF structures for reduction of lateral acceleration.

J	Guillemin, A; Morel, N				Guillemin, A; Morel, N			An innovative lighting controller integrated in a self-adaptive building control system	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Solar Energy in Buildings (CISBST99)	SEP 22-23, 1999	LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND			lighting control; adaptive control; monitoring; genetic algorithms; fuzzy logic; energy; commercial buildings		An innovative and self-adaptive integrated system for building energy and comfort management has been developed. Both artificial and natural lighting controllers have been designed in order to fit the integrated approach. The shading device controller is split into two parts depending on the user presence. When the user is present, priority is given to visual comfort, and when he is absent, priority is given to thermal aspects (heating/cooling energy saving). The artificial Lighting controller is used to complete the illuminance in the room up to the level desired by the user, which is learned by the system through the user wishes. Many simulations have allowed comparing different variants of the lighting controllers. The models used in the control system are regularly adapted to the measurements. Therefore, the system continuously adapts itself to the environment and the room characteristics. Four months of experiments in the occupied LESO-PB office building have demonstrated that this integrated system leads to interesting energy saving (25% less of total energy consumption) compared to a conventional one.

In doing so we present a novel approach to the implementation of IB based on a hierarchical fuzzy genetic mufti embedded-agent architecture comprising a low-level behaviour based reactive layer whose outputs are co-ordinated in a fuzzy way according to deliberative plans. The fuzzy rules related to resident's comfort are learnt online in a short time interval using our patented Fuzzy-Genetic techniques (British Patent 99-10539.7) from the resident's actual behaviour in a learning phase. Our approach utilises an intelligent agent approach to autonomously governing the building environment. We discuss the role of learning in building control systems, and contrast this approach with existing IB solutions. We explain the importance of acquiring information from sensors, rather than relying on pre programmed models, to determine user needs. We describe how our architecture, consisting of distributed embedded agents, utilises sensory information to learn to perform tasks related to user comfort, energy conservation, and safety. We show how these agents, employing a behaviour-based approach derived from robotics research, are able to continuously learn and adapt to individuals within a building, whilst always providing a fast, safe response to any situation. Such a system could be used to provide support for older people, or people with disabilities, allowing them greater independence and quality of life.

Seven major variables determine how warm a person feels: his activity level(M), his clothing insulation(icl), his mechanical efficiency(eta) and the four environmental variables of air speed (v) and temperature (t(a)), humidity (P-a) and mean radiant temperature (t(r)). Equivalent temperature is a thermal comfort index that combines the thermal effects of air temperature, mean radiant temperature and air velocity on people. Thus the two indexes equivalent temperature and air humidity include information of the all four environmental variables. In this paper a new structure of comfort sensor, which aims at measuring predicted mean vote (PMV) and new standard effective temperature (SET*), is proposed. And a kind of "transform" method is used in the realization of SET* sensor of this sort, theory derivation has proven the reasonability of this method. A simple SET* sensor is developed, and a 90(similar tomm) diameter globe made from copper is utilized instead of a equivalent temperature sensor in the SET* sensor. Simulation results shows that the SET* sensor can be used as a comfort sensor under typical indoor climates.

However the effect of changing the control strategy (i.e. effect on indoor comfort and energy consumption) is usually the most difficult to predict. To achieve this more easily, a new simulation tool, QUICKcontrol, was developed. In this paper, the new tool is used to investigate the energy savings potential in the Engineering Tower Building (ETB) of the University of Pretoria. The influence of reset control, economizer cycle combined with CO2 control on the outside air ventilation rate and better system start-stop times were investigated. The simulation models were firstly verified with actual measurements obtained from the existing system to confirm their accuracy for realistic control retrofit simulations. With the aid of the integrated simulation tool it was possible to predict savings of 491 MWh per year (34% building energy saving) by implementing these control strategies. These control strategies can be implemented in the building with a direct payback period of less than 9 months. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is especially true for high technology products. In the last years we acquired experience in designing and re-designing the small mobile robot Alice. In the first part of this paper we present an overview of the prototype family of Alice and the improvements achieved so far. Applications are often the final objective but also an incentive to correct and enhance the robot abilities. In the second part, research carried out with Alice and various real-world applications, which exceed the robot's use as a research prototype, will be presented. They include local and global localization, map building, control strategies for semi-autonomous operation via Internet and Matlab, its use for robot soccer tournaments and as a research platform for studies of collective behaviors, and finally, ludic applications.

Also, it would be safe to estimate that 50% of all electrical devices now contain some form of digital control or computer. Non-linear devices like switching power supplies, uninterruptible power supplies (U.P.S.'s), adjustable speed drives, and solid state ballasts are power conversion devices that utilize power electronic switches to convert supplied AC voltage to DC land often return it to a controlled AC) for specialized use. Computer controlled electrical equipment like smart switches, lighting, appliances and building control systems and their respective communication and interface networks are connected to the same electrical supply. Such products are relatively new, when compared to the age of the electrical distribution infrastructure that supplies them and the generation and traditional practices that support it. For example, the adjustable speed AC drive for use with AC motors became commercially viable and reliable approximately 15 years ago. Since then, more than 1 million drives have been installed in the United States, however, only 9% of electric motors yet are controlled by a drive(1), which points towards continued increases in the use of drives. Conversely, electric motors, which are linear devices, have been in existence and operating for 100 years, though they are fundamentally unchanged in their method of operation.	5 12 Grp Ltd, Shorewood, WI 53211 USA	Hayes, ND (reprint author), 5 12 Grp Ltd, 4141 N Maryland Ave, Shorewood, WI 53211 USA.

The concept is to allow structures, vibrating at different frequencies, to exert control forces upon one another to reduce the overall responses of the system. Previous studies have identified optimal coupled building configurations and have introduced passive, active and "smart" damping control strategies. This paper will focus on the application of "smart" dampers as coupling link devices to produce control forces between three tall buildings. Smart dampers are semi-active dampers capable of changing their dynamic characteristics in real-time to allow for a variety of control forces to be produced without requiring significant energy. A clipped optimal control strategy is employed for the smart dampers that can provide increased performance, over a comparable passive control strategy, during moderately severe seismic events.

As computing power and data become more distributed, static design of interactions for dynamic environments may not always produce usable interfaces between people and machines. We have designed a model-based, dynamic interaction design system called DIG (Dynamic Interaction Generation) and implemented it in a research prototype using the domain of digital building control systems. DIGBE is a three-tiered system modeling the domain data, the current interaction, and the device-specific presentation of the interaction. It responds to changes in the environment and creates, in real-time, an interaction tailored to the current user role, access level, and task. Each interaction is also specialized to match the nature of the information that is currently the focus of the interaction. Full automatic synthesis of any interface at any time may not yet be feasible, but DIGBE demonstrates that it is both possible and useful to automatically generate user interfaces. This may be especially true for complex systems domains with variable components but known task structures.

A full-scale 3-storey steel building with active bracing control system was tested at a three-dimensional shaking table of NCREE, Taiwan. The active bracing control system was installed at the first floor. Three different control algorithms were used for the experimental verification: static-output-feedback LQR control modal control with direct output feedback, and static-output-feedback with variable gain. It is concluded that within the maximum capacity of the actuator in the experiment all the three control algorithms performed well and almost 50 per cent of displacement as well as the acceleration of each floor response was reduced.

J	Seem, JE; House, JM; Monroe, RH				Seem, JE; House, JM; Monroe, RH			On-line monitoring and fault detection	ASHRAE JOURNAL			English	Article								Modern energy management and control systems have alarm and trend features that allow building operators to monitor and troubleshoot building systems. The alarm feature can provide nearly immediate feedback when, for instance, a sensor value is outside specified limits. Using the trend feature, building operators can view graphs of sensor and controller output versus time. In the case of an alarm, information obtained using the trend feature can assist the operator in isolating the cause of the alarm. However, it can be difficult to select the alarm limits. If the limits are too narrow, the building control system likely will issue a number of false alarms and building operators eventually will ignore them. If the limits are too wide, faulty conditions will tend to go unnoticed because alarms are not issued.

J	Chan, EHW; Chan, ATS				Chan, EHW; Chan, ATS			Imposing ISO 9000 quality assurance system on statutory agents in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article								A major part of the building control system in any country has to do with quality assurance (QA) of building the process and the products. As in many other countries, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region delegates part of its statutory role to statutory agents to deal with the QA function. As a case study in the context of the Hong Kong construction industry, the relationship between QA and the role of statutory agents is investigated. An authorized person (AP), normally an architect, is the statutory agent as an integral part of the property development control system in Hong Kong. Although AP's statutory roles have already been recognized, their formal roles in respect of QA have never been studied. This paper, being supported by a research project carried out in 1997, presents the result of a study on the relationship between the QA system and the AP practice. The research revealed that in the APs' professional practice most of them have a basic concept and awareness of QA. Their checklists to run projects are similar to a QA manual. To discharge their statutory duties APs are already performing most of the QA standards similar to the ISO 9001 requirements. This paper concludes that the ISO 9000 requirements could be an extra administrative burden to a statutory agent.

J	Zhang, Q; Stanley, SJ				Zhang, Q; Stanley, SJ			Real-time water treatment process control with artificial neural networks	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article							INTERNAL MODEL CONTROL; NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS	The coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation processes involve many complex physical and chemical phenomena and thus are difficult to model for process control with traditional methods. Proposed is the use of a neural network process control system for the coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation processes. Presented is a review of influential control parameters and control requirements for these processes followed by the development of a feed forward neural network control scheme. A neural network process model was built based on nearly 2,000 sets of process control data. This model formed the major component of a software controller and was found to consistently predict the optimum alum and power activated carbon doses for different control actions. With minor modifications, the approach illustrated can be used for building control models for other water treatment processes.

ART-based automatic generation of membership functions for fuzzy controllers in robotics	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article							RULES	Designing fuzzy controllers involves both identifying suitable fuzzy dicretizations of the input and output spaces (number of fuzzy terms and related membership functions) and drawing effective rule bases (hopefully compact and complete). Learning from examples is a very efficient way for acquiring knowledge. Moreover, providing reliable examples is easier than directly designing and coding a control strategy. Supervised learning is therefore appealing for automatically building control systems. It may also be used as quick start-up for applications requiring further on-line learning (through reinforce-based techniques or processing of further appropriate examples). Supervised techniques for building rule bases from suitable examples generally rely on pre-defined fuzzy discretizations of the input and output spaces. This paper proposes the use of an ART-based neural architecture for identifying, starting from examples, an appropriate set of fuzzy terms and associated membership functions. These data are then used by an ID3-based machine learning algorithm for building fuzzy control rules. The ART framework provides fast convergence and incremental building of classes, gracefully accounting for the integration of new sample data. The whole chain (the neural architecture for building fuzzy discretizations and the machine learning algorithm for drawing fuzzy rules) has been proved on examples provided by several operators, with different skills, driving a real vehicle along the right-hand wall in an indoor environment. The obtained results are shown, discussed and compared with the performance of controllers using human defined fuzzy partitions.

The concept is to allow structures, vibrating at different frequencies, to exert control forces upon one another to reduce the overall responses of the system. Selecting a coupled building configuration that provides for the greatest response reduction is important in determining which building clusters are candidates for coupling. This paper studies the effect of the height, mass and stiffness of two actively coupled high-rise buildings and the location of a single coupling link. Connecting the buildings at the top of the shorter building provides the greatest response reduction. A particular coupled building system is used to shown that a smart damping strategy can achieve nearly the same performance as the active control strategy, giving 99% of the response reduction achievable in the active control.

J	Bauer, M; Scartezzini, JL				Bauer, M; Scartezzini, JL			A simplified correlation method accounting for heating and cooling loads in energy-efficient buildings	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						correlation method; HVAC control system; energy-efficient buildings		Simplified correlation methods are powerful tools to compare both the energy performance of buildings and the efficiency of different HVAC control systems. For buildings in which both heating and cooling loads contribute to the energy consumption, widely used methods, like the energy signature models, are not appropriate, since they cannot simultaneously handle both heating and cooling aspects. This paper proposes a new correlation method to overcome this difficulty. The 'Eta method' deals with internal gains, as well as solar gains, and can be used to calculate a utilization factor for free gains in the heating and cooling periods. Two examples to illustrate the method are given. The first one is a passive solar office room, on which different blind controllers were tested by simulation. The second example is a non-residential building in which two HVAC controllers were carefully monitored. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

Artificial neural networks can also be used to emulate the plant dynamics, in order to estimate future plant outputs and obtain plant input/output sensitivity information for on-line neural control adaptation, This paper describes a functional link neural network approach to performing the HVAC thermal dynamic system identification, Methodologies to reduce inputs of the functional link network to reduce the complexity and speed up the training speed will be presented. Analysis and comparison between the functional link network approach and the conventional network approach for the HVAC thermal modeling will also be presented.

Most of the work done in behavior-based robotics involves a decomposition process (in which the behavior required is broken down into simpler sub-components) and an integration process (in which the modules designed to produce the sub-behaviors are put together). We claim that decomposition and integration should be the result of an adaptation process and not of the decision of the experimenter. In this paper we will support this hypothesis by showing how in Mo different cases a more simple and robust solution can be obtained by letting the entire behavior emerge through an evolutionary technique than by trying to design a set of modules and to coordinate them.

The proposed HVAC control strategy goal is not to maintain a constant indoor air temperature but a constant indoor thermal comfort. This is realized by the implementation of a fuzzy reasoning that rakes into account the vagueness and the subjectivity of the human sensation of thermal comfort in the formulation of the control action that should be applied to the HVAC system in order to bring the indoor climate into comfort conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy makes it possible to maximize both thermal comfort of the occupants and the energy economy of HVAC systems.

In order to find an on-line solution of this multiobjective process optimization problem, a new supervisory control concept has been developed at IITB. By means of a simple slide button the user is enable to choose his individual weighting factors for the economy and comfort criteria which are taken to optimize the reference commands of heating and ventilation controllers. The disturbing influence of external climate changes is considered as well as variations of the room occupancy. The performance of the fuzzy-based multiobjective optimization concept which has been implemented and is being trialled in a test environment at IITB is analyzed and discussed by means of practice-relevant simulation results.

To ensure commercial application it is necessary that such a controller is no more complex to commission than a standard PI controller, therefore the commissioning of the neural network must be entirely automated. Methods for incrementally training the network are introduced which avoid the control problems resulting from using an initially untrained network.

J	Nolfi, S				Nolfi, S			Using emergent modularity to develop control systems for mobile robots	ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR			English	Article						autonomous robots; behavior-based robotics; modularity; neural networks; genetic algorithms		A new way of building control systems, known as behavior-based robotics, has recently been proposed to overcome the difficulties of the traditional artificial intelligence approach to robotics. This new approach is based on she idea of providing the robot with a range of simple behaviors and letting the environment determine which behavior should have control at any given time. We will present a set of experiments in which neural networks with different architectures have been trained so control a mobile robot designed to keep an arena clear by picking up trash objects and releasing them outside the arena. Controller weights are selected using a form of genetic algorithm and do not change during the lifetime (i.e., no learning occurs). We will compare, in simulation and on a real robot, five different network architectures and will show that a network that allows for fine-grained modularity achieves significantly better performance. By comparing the functionality of each network module and ifs interaction with a description of the simple behavior components, we will show that it is not possible to find simple correlations; rather module switching and interaction are correlated with low-level sensorimotor mappings. This implies that the engineering-oriented approach to behavior-based robotics might have serious limitations because it is difficult to know in advance the appropriate mappings between behavior components and sensorimotor activity for complex tasks.

Researchers in the HVAC field have stressed the importance of self-learning in building control systems and the integration of optimal control and other advanced techniques into the formulation of such systems. This paper describes a functional link neural network approach to perform the HVAC thermal system identification and modeling. Artificial neural networks are used to emulate the plant dynamics in order to estimate future plant outputs and obtain plant input/output sensitivity information for on-line neural control adaptation. Methodologies to appropriately reduce the inputs, thus the complexity, of the functional link network in order to speed up the training will be presented. This paper will also analyze and compare the performance and complexity between the functional link network and conventional network approaches for the HVAC thermal system identification and modeling.

With the beam lines and equipment defined in the new database, control facilities are being added by incrementally enhancing the classes and adding new methods to the database scheme. Using the OO database helps to design the new system in a transparent way. Real-world objects such as beam lines or crates are uniquely mapped to the corresponding objects in the database. The new database allows seamless integration of data into programs written in OO languages such as C++ and Java. The WWW interface to the database gives a familiar look and feel and has been provided with relatively little effort. In this paper we present an overview of the project and the employed methods. The choice of the database management system, the implementation of the Beam Instrumentation (BI) database and its use in controls as well as the benefits of the approach will be discussed in some detail.

The goal of the control strategy was to utilize building thermal mass to limit the peak cooling load for continued building operation in the event of the loss of one of the four central chiller units. The algorithm was first developed and evaluated through simulation and then evaluated through tests on two identical buildings. The east building utilized the existing building control strategy, while the west building used the precooling strategy developed for this project. Consistent with simulation predictions, the precooling control strategy successfully limited the peak load to 75% of the cooling capacity for the west building, while the east building operated at 100% of capacity. Precooling of the building mass provided an economical alternative to the purchase of an additional chiller unit. The estimated cost of installing an additional chiller was approximately $500,000. Computer models developed for this project also showed that precooling based upon cooling cost minimization could result in savings of approximately $25,000 per month during the peak cooling season. The building model was validated with experimental results and could be used in the development of a cost minimization strategy.

This paper argues that computational modeling can also successfully apply to the building operation phase. To demonstrate this potential the paper explores a simulation-assisted building control strategy. Specifically, the use of generate-and-test as well as bi-directional inference methods is proposed to derive preferable control schemes and required attributes for control variables based on parametric and iterative simulation runs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated via illustrative computational examples from the thermal control domain.

The class of systems considered have structural complexity exhibiting a closed-form model of the underlying process. The approach may be described in three parts where in the first stage a rule-based classifier ('spy') extracts 'states of performance' from the process. It is shown that the rule-premise resembles a possibility based control chart and that the possibilistic version, embedded in a rule-based system, offers a comprehensive man-process interface while having a similar or slightly improved speed of detection. The reliability can be quantified based on a finite set of abstract states over which a certainty measure is defined. A prediction for a specified reliability interval of time is done by using a qualitative model akin to Markov stochastic processes and consequently decisions are made to alter the system structure. This framework allows distinct classes of uncertainty to be considered.		Wolkenhauer, O (reprint author), UMIST,CONTROL SYST CTR,MANCHESTER M60 1QD,LANCS,ENGLAND.

Low-energy building design is achieved through a whole building approach where the designers, builders, and operators understand how a building interacts with its systems, its activities, and its surrounding environment. The whole-building design approach was followed when designing, constructing, and commissioning the Thermal Test Facility (TTF) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado. The projected savings for this laboratory building are over 70% when compared with a building compliant with the Federal Energy Code (10CFR435). The TTF uses managed glazing, engineered overhangs, a good thermal package, evaporative cooling, passive solar strategies including direct solar gain heating and daylighting, and a well-engineered automatic building control system. This paper discusses the important steps to designing, constructing, and commissioning low-energy commercial buildings, experiences gained from constructing the TTF, and preliminary TTF operating data.

In the proposed system, building equipment is horizontally distributed on a network and autonomously works by sharing communication data on the network according to objects for building control systems. The proposed system deals with the requirements of building control systems and offers its users, such as building designers, a user-friendly tool for the system construction. In this paper, we call such a communication platform an autonomous decentralized system (ADS) platform. By utilizing the ADS platform, the building control system obtains two ADS properties, autonomous controllability and autonomous coordinability. Furthermore, the proposed system can realize the on-line expandability, on-line maintainability and fault tolerance of the system by relaying messages between the building system objects on the ADS platform without specifying the sending addresses.

Our main objective is to define a conceptual framework to aid building control system designers in their tasks of specification, analysis, tests and changes of integrated building control strategies. The formal approach proposed can facilitate the development of complete integrated building automation systems, lowering their cost and improving their flexibility, reliability and intelligence (decision making), when compared with the nonformal environments available today. The methodology is based on the supervisory control theory introduced by Ramadge and Wonhan, through an input/output interpretation. We claim that a more balanced automation project could be achieved by using this formalism in a net representation called PFS/MFG (Production Flow Schema/Mark Flow Graph), a Petri Net extension. This formalism introduces a hierarchical approach and high level elements to which we attached an estimated time. This formal technique can also represent the interaction between the supervisory system and human operators. The model obtained allows the analysis of behavioral and structural properties of the supervisory control system, including reachability, liveness, invariants and synchronic distances.

Three experiments are included in the development effort, namely: (a) Single-loop control system - air (b) Single-loop control system - water and (c) Multiple-zone economizer cycle. The systems make use of pneumatic, electronic (analog), and direct-digital (microprocessor-based) control units. All three systems are designed to have reproducible and adjustable characteristics and are fully instrumented to permit quantitative measurements and recordings of steady-state and dynamic behavior. A mathematical model built with MATLAB-SIMULINK is used to check the dynamics of the single-loop-air experiment. initial classroom experience indicates the approach used makes possible a highly-effective instructional environment.

J	Clapp, MD				Clapp, MD			Years in control: A profile of Satchwell Control Systems	GEC REVIEW			English	Article								The largest buildings controls company in the UK, Satchwell Control Systems offers an extensive range of products from valves, actuators and environment sensors through to sophisticated building management systems which utilize the latest computer technologies. Despite the highly adverse market conditions that continue to prevail in the UK and European construction industries, Satchwell continues to expand by the aggressive development of its business in overseas markets, notably Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. Sustained investment in product development to meet ever changing market requirements and the recent introduction of the latest generation of Building Management System, BAS 2800, are key parts of the strategy to become a major player in world markets. This continues a strong tradition of pioneering technical innovation which has been pre-eminent throughout the Company's 75-year history. This paper charts not only that history, but also highlights some of those technological achievements, which include many world firsts.								Clapp M. D., 1989, GEC Review, V5, P22; Clapp M.

However, further expansion and continued reliable, cost-effective operation are necessary to improve the economic viability of the system. Evaluation of the system capacity and the connected loads shows that the system is operating at less than half of design thermal capacity, and can support considerable additional expansion if the flow and Delta T are controlled at the connected buildings. Control system improvements, particularly for the production wells and district heating loop circulation pumps, will provide improved operation and reduced operating cost. System maintenance, especially corrosion control, will help assure continued reliable service.									0	0	0	0	0	GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES COUNCIL	DAVIS	PO BOX 1350, DAVIS, CA 95617	0193-5933		0-934412-80-4	GEOTH RES T			1996	20						51	58					8	Energy & Fuels	Energy & Fuels	BH49E	WOS:A1996BH49E00007					2020-01-29
