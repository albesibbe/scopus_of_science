Existing efforts mostly focus on optimization of a certain control objective (e.g., hydrogen consumption), without sufficiently considering the implications for on-board power sources degradation. To address this deficiency, this article proposes a cost-optimal, predictive energy management strategy, with an explicit consciousness of degradation of both fuel cell and battery systems. Specifically, we contribute two main points to the relevant literature, with the purpose of distinguishing our study from existing ones. First, a model predictive control framework, for the first time, is established to minimize the total running cost of a fuel cell/battery hybrid electric bus, inclusive of hydrogen cost and costs caused by fuel cell and battery degradation. The efficacy of this framework is evaluated, accounting for various sizes of prediction horizon and prediction uncertainties. Second, the effects of driving and pricing scenarios on the optimized vehicular economy are explored. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Batteries; energy management; fuel cell; hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); predictive control; sustainable transport","Economics; Energy management; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Hydrogen; Model predictive control; Secondary batteries; Solar cells; Battery degradation; Enabling technologies; Energy management strategies; Hybrid electric bus; Hydrogen consumption; Prediction uncertainty; Predictive control; Sustainable transport; Hybrid vehicles",,,,,"706253-pPHEV-H2020-MSCA-IF-2015

However, conventional lane-keeping assistance systems (LKASs) have a limited level of automation, while fully autonomous lane-keeping systems have shortcomings regarding reliability. To address these issues, an advanced LKAS with two switchable assistance modes, namely, the lane departure prevention mode and the lane-keeping co-pilot mode, is proposed in this paper. First, the system structure is constructed. Then, the functions and control strategies for the two assistance modes are defined. Next, the controller algorithms are designed using the learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) method to compensate for modeling errors. Within the framework of LBMPC, an oracle is built to learn the unmodeled dynamics using an extended Kalman filter. Moreover, optimization problems are formulated to achieve the control objectives regarding driving safety and driver acceptance. Finally, driver-in-the-loop experiments carried out on a driving simulator prove that both assistance modes are effective. Furthermore, the lane-keeping co-pilot mode can help reduce the driving burden in the sense of avoiding frequent steering correction. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","lane departure prevention (LDP); Lane-keeping assistance system (LKAS); lane-keeping co-pilot; learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC)","Kalman filters; Model predictive control; Assistance system; Controller algorithm; Lane departure; Lane keeping; Learning Based Models; Level of automations; Optimization problems; Steering correction; Learning systems",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51625503, 51505247, 51605245","Manuscript received March 23, 2017; revised February 6, 2018 and July 12, 2018; accepted December 14, 2018.

The path tracking issue is formulated as an optimal control problem with dynamic disturbance, i.e., the future road curvature. A discrete-time preview controller is then designed on the top of a linear augmented error system, in which the disturbances within a finite preview window are augmented as part of the state vector. The obtained optimal steering control law is in an analytic form and consists of two parts: 1) a feedback control responding to tracking errors and 2) a feedforward control dealing with the future road curvatures. The designed control's nature, capacity, computation load, and underlying mechanism are revealed by the analysis of system responses in the time domain and the frequency domain, theoretical steady-state error, and comparison with the model predictive control (MPC). The algorithm was implemented on an automated vehicle platform, a hybrid Lincoln MKZ. The experimental and simulation results are then presented to demonstrate the improved performance in tracking accuracy, steering smoothness, and computational efficiency compared to the MPC and the full-state feedback control. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Autonomous vehicles; path tracking; preview control; vehicle dynamics control","Automobile steering equipment; Closed loop control systems; Closed loop systems; Computational efficiency; Errors; Feedback control; Feedforward control; Frequency domain analysis; Model predictive control; Optimal control systems; Predictive control systems; Roads and streets; State feedback; Steering; Time domain analysis; Dynamic disturbances; Experimental validations; Optimal control problem; Path tracking; Path tracking control; Preview control; Steering control law; Vehicle dynamics controls; Autonomous vehicles",,,,,,,,"Yang, J., Hou, E., Zhou, M., Front sensor and GPS-based lateral control of automated vehicles (2013) IEEE Trans.
